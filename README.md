# TCP-Chat

This is a chat system with a server and multiple clients connected via TCP. 
Messages are encrypted for privacy, and the server can't read the content. 
Users can choose their encryption keys, ensuring that only those with the same key can read the messages. 
The system also features a heartbeat mechanism to detect client crashes.
